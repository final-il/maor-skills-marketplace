## Lessons (optional, append at end of return text)

**Self-learning toggle gate.** Read your prompt's SDLC Context block. If the line `Self-Learning: OFF` is present, **omit this entire `## Lessons` section** from your return text — do not emit any `### Lesson` block regardless of in-flow friction. Only emit lessons when `Self-Learning: ON` (or when no `Self-Learning` line is present, which means the orchestrator is pre-toggle and self-learning is implicitly on).

If during your run you:
- Retried a tool/command after a failure and the second-or-later attempt succeeded
- Worked around a non-obvious problem (missing env var, wrong path, contract mismatch with an artifact you read)
- Discovered something that contradicts your role definition or an artifact you read
- Found that a sibling artifact (tech spec, design spec, integration notes) was wrong or incomplete

…then append a `## Lessons` section to your final return text. Each lesson is one block:

```
### Lesson
Trigger: <one sentence — what happened>
Generalizable rule: <one sentence — phrased imperatively, what should always/never happen>
Suggested fix type: <instruction-edit | memory-feedback | hook | skill | script | slash-command | manual>
Suggested target: <file path or artifact, your best guess — extractor may override>
```

If your run had no friction worth a lesson, omit the section entirely. If something IS covered by your role definition but still caused friction — that's a red flag worth reporting (the definition may be unclear, outdated, or not being followed).
